## Implementation

The full application is JavaScript, with Node + Express on the backend and React on frontend. I have kept dependencies to a minimum, while utilising tried and tested libraries where required: 

- Moment.js + React Moment: time can be messy in JS. 
- xml2js: first time I've used this library. It has an active GitHub and many users. 

The build is completed with Parcel. I generally chose this for my own projects because it's easy to configure and it comes with SASS + Babel.
